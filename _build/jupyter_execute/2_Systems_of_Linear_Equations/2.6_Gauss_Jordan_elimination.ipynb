    "**Gauss-Jordan elimination (GJE)**, named after [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) and German geodesist [Wilhelm Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Jordan_(geodesist)), is similar to [Gaussian elimination](gaussian-elimination-section) with the difference that the augmented matrix is row reduced so that the values of the pivot elements are 1 and are the only non-zero element in the column. This allows the solution to be read from the final augmented matrix without the need to perform back substitution. A matrix in this form is said to be in reduced row echelon form.\n",
