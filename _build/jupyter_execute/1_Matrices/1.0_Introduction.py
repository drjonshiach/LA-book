# # Matrices
# 
# Matrices are a set of numbers or other mathematical object that are arranged in a rectangular array. They provide us with a convenient way to represent systems of equations, sets of co-ordinates, collections of vectors and transformations. They are fundamental to the field of linear algebra which is why we are going to start the unit with looking at them.
# 
# ## Learning outcomes
# 
# On successful completion of this chapter students will be able to:
# 
# -  define and [index](indexing-a-matrix-section) matrices;
# -  perform the arithmetic operations of [addition](matrix-addition-section), [multiplication by a scalar](scalar-multiplication-of-matrices), [matrix multiplication](matrix-multiplication-definition), [matrix exponents](matrix-exponents-definition) and [matrix transpose](matrix-transpose-definition);  
# -  recognise and define special matrices such as [diagonal matrices](diagonal-matrix-definition), the [zero matrix](zero-matrix-definition), the [identity matrix](identity-matrix-definition) and [symmetric matrices](symmetric-matrix-definition);
# -  calculate the determinant of a [$2\times 2$](2x2-determinant-definition) and [$n\times n$](nxn-determinant-definition) matrix, the [adjoint](adjoint-definition) and [inverse]&emsp; (inverse-matrix-definition) of a non-singular square matrix using the [adjoint-determinant formula](adjoint-determinant-formula-definition);
# - perform [algebraic manipulation](matrix-algebra-section) of equations involving matrices.
