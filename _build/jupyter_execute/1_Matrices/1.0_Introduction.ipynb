    "Matrices are a set of numbers or other mathematical object that are arranged in a rectangular array. They provide us with a convenient way to represent systems of equations, sets of co-ordinates, collections of vectors and transformations. They are fundamental to the field of linear algebra which is why we are going to start the unit with looking at them.\n",
