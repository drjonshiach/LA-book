# ```
# 
# The area of mathematics dealing with describing geometry in terms of coordinate systems, hence as points and vectors, is called **coordinate geometry** or **Cartesian geometry** (named after French mathematician and philosopher [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)). In this chapter we systematise the basic knowledge and understanding of points, lines and planes.
# 
# ## Learning outcomes
# 
# On successful completion of this chapters students will be able to:
# 
# - define a line using the [vector equation of a line](vector-equation-of-a-line-definition);
# - determine whether two lines [intersect](line-line-intersection-definition), are [parallel](parallel-lines-definition), [skew](skew-lines-definition) and/or [perpendicular](perpendicular-lines-definition);
# - define a plane using the [point-normal definition of a plane](point-normal-definition);
# - determine the [intersection of two planes](intersection-of-planes-section); 
# - calculate the shortest distance between [two points](shortest-distance-between-two-points), [a point and a line](point-line-distance-theorem), [between two skew lines](line-line-distance-theorem) and [a point and a plane](ex4.7).
