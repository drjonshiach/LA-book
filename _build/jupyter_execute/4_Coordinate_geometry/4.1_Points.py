# In his works the *Elements*, Euclid described a *point* as *"that which has no part"*. A point has position only, it has no length, width or thickness, and thus no area or volume. As we have [already seen](euclidean-space-section), a typical point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is described by its co-ordinates $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$, where the $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$. We also think of $\mathbb{R}^0$ as a single point. This might seem a bit strange because what does a $0$-tuple even mean? However, it makes sense for us to adopt this absolutely standard convention.

# The position of a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be defined by its co-ordinates $(x, y, z)$.
