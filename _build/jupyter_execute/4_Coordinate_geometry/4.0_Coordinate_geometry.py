# ## Definition
# 
# The area of mathematics dealing with describing geometry in terms of **coordinate systems**, hence as points and vectors, is called **Cartesian geometry** (named after French mathematician and philosopher [Ren√© Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)) or **coordinate geometry**. In this chapter we systematise the basic knowledge and understanding of the terms **point**, **line** and **plane**.
# 
# (points-section)=
# ## Points in $\mathbb{R}^n$
# 
# In his works the *Elements*, Euclid described a *point* as *"that which has no part"*
# A point has position only, it has no length, width or thickness, and thus no area or volume. As we've already seen, a typical point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is described by its co-ordinates $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$, where the $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$. We also think of $\mathbb{R}^0$ as a single point. This might seem a bit strange because what does a $0$-tuple even mean? However, it makes sense for us to adopt this absolutely standard convention.
# 
# 
# (lines-section)=
# ## Lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$
# 
# Euclid defined a line as having *"breadthless length"* which is another way of saying a line is a one dimensional object that has a length but no breadth or volume. Given that we have already taken the time to introduce vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in [Vectors](vectors-chapter) it makes sense to use them to define what it means to be a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

# 
# Let $P = (p_1, \ldots ,p_n)$ be a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{d} = (d_1, \ldots, d_n)$ a non-zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The line $\ell$ [^1] which passes through $P$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$ has equation
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: line-vector-equation
# 
# Q = P + t\mathbf{d},
# ```
# where $Q$ is a general point on $\ell$ and $t\in \mathbb{R}$ is known as a **parameter**.
# ````
# 
# [^1]: $\ell$ is used here instead of $l$ to avoid confusing with a 1 or uppercase i.
# 
# In other words, every point on $\ell$ is obtained by adding some scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to $P$ ({numref}`line-vector-equation-figure`). So $\ell$ is the line which passes through $P$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$. We call the vector $\mathbf{d}$ a **direction vector** of the line.
# 
# ```{figure} ../Images/line_vector_equation.png
# :name: line-vector-equation-figure
# 
# The position of any point on the line $\ell$ can be obtained by adding a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to $P$.
# ```
# 
# In practice one can determine the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ of a line by taking any two distinct points $P_1$ and  $P_2$ on $\ell$ and setting $\mathbf{d}=P_2 - P_1$ and $P$ in the line equation to be any point on the line. In particular, $\mathbf{d}$ and $P$ are not unique. If fact, one could choose any non-zero scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to express the same line. Take for instance the $x$-axis in $\mathbb{R}^3$. $\ell$ can be described as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#    Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
# \end{align*}
# 
# which means we are taking $P=(0,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{d}=(1,0,0)$ and for example the point $Q=(5,0,0)$ is found when $t=5$. Alternatively we can describe the $x$-axis as 
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     Q = \begin{pmatrix} 71 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 71 + 5t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
# \end{align*} 
# 
# which means we are taking $P=(71,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{d}=(5,0,0)$ and the point $Q = (5,0,0)$ is found when $71 +5t = 5 \implies t = -\dfrac{66}{5}$.

# ````
# 
# To determine whether two lines intersect we simply equate the vector equations of the two lines and attempt to solve for $t_1$ and $t_2$.
# 
# ````{admonition} Example 4.2

# :name: line-line-intersection-example
# 
# Three lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are defined as $\ell_1: (1 + t, -3 + 2t, t)$, $\ell_2: (6 - t, -5 - 2t, t - 1)$ and $\ell_3: (6 + 2t, -11 + 2t, -2 - t)$. Determine the points of intersection between the three lines (if possible).
# 
# ```{dropdown} Solution
# Equating $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ gives
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     1 + t_1 &= 6 - t_2, \\
#     -3 + 2t_1 &= -5 + 2t_2, \\
#     t_1 &= -1 + t_2.
# \end{align*}
# 
# The third equation is $t_1 = t_2 - 1$ and substituting into the first equation gives $t_2 = 3$ so $t_1 = 2$. Substituting these into the second equation gives $-3 + 2(2) = -5 + 2(3)$ which is $1 = 1$ so $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ intersect. To find the point of intersection we substitute $t_1$ or $t_2$ into the equations for $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ respectively.
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 + 2 \\ -3 + 2(2) \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}  &= \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \\

# \end{align*}
# 
# So $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ intersect at $(3, 1, 2)$.

#     t_1 &= -2 - t_3.
# \end{align*}
# 
# Substituting the third equation into the first equation gives $1 - 2 - t_3 = 6 + t_3$ so $t_3 = -\frac{7}{2}$ and $t_1 = -\frac{21}{2}$. Substituting these into the second equation gives $-3 + 2(-\frac{21}{2}) = -11 + 2(-\frac{7}{2})$ which is $-24 = -18$ which is a contradiction so no values of $t_1$ or $t_3$ satisfy $\ell_1 = \ell_3$ and $\ell_1$ and $\ell_3$ do not intersect.
# 
# Equating $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ gives the system
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     6 - t_2 &= 6 + 2t_3, \\
#     -5 + 2t_2 &= -11 + 2t_3, \\
#     -1 + t_2 &= -2 - t_3.
# \end{align*}
# 
# The third equation gives $t_2 = -1 - t_3$ and substituting into the first equation gives $6 + 1 + t_3 = 6 + 2t_3$ so $t_3 = 1$ and $t_2 = -2$. Substituting these into the second equation gives $-5 + 2(-2) = -11 + 2(1)$ which is $-9 = -9$ so $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ intersect. Substituting $t_2$ and $t_3$ into the equations for $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \begin{pmatrix} 6 - (-2) \\ -5 + 2(-2) \\ -1 + (-2) \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -9 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, \\
