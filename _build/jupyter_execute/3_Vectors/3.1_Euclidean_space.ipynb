    "Before we discuss vectors it is useful to first define [**Euclidean space**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) which is the mathematical system which vectors are most commonly applied. Attributed to the Greek mathematician [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid), Euclidean space is a representation of physical space where the position of a point in the space can be described by the signed distance along perpendicular real numbers lines called **axes** (singular: axis). \n",
    "\n",
    "An $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is defined by $n$ perpendicular real axes and is referred to as $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For example, consider the diagram of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ in {numref}`R3-figure`. Here we have a representation of a 3-dimensional Euclidean space defined by the 3 axes labelled $x$, $y$ and $z$. This representation uses the [**right-hand rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule) so-called because if we use the thumb on our right hand to represent the $x$ axis, the index finger for the $y$ axis and the middle finger for the $z$ axis then holding out the right hand palm up with the thumb and index finger at right-angles and the middle finger pointing up then we have the axis configuration shown in {numref}`R3-figure`. Doing similar with the left hand gives the **left-hand rule** where the $x$ axis is pointing in the opposite direction than in the right-hand rule. \n",

    "The position of a point in Euclidean space can be defined by its **co-ordinates** which is an ordered set known as a **tuple** where each element contains the signed distances along each axis, e.g., $(x, y, z)$ where $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. "
