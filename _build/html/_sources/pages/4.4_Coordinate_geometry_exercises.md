Given the following position vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$

$$ \begin{align*} 
    \vec{a} &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, &
    \vec{b} &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, &

Two lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are defined by $\ell_1: (1 + 2t, -t, 1 + 3t)^\mathsf{T}$ and $\ell_2: (1 + 2t, 4, 7 - t)^\mathsf{T}$ respectively.

(a) &emsp; find the intersection of the lines or show they are skew;

(b) &emsp; find the distance between the point with position vector $\vec{p} = (0, -1, 3)^\mathsf{T}$ and $\ell_1$.

(c) &emsp; find the shortest distance between the lines;

Find the point where the line $\ell:(1 + 2t, 2 + t, -1 + 4t)^\mathsf{T}$ meets the plane $6x - y - 4z = 3$.

Consider the diagram below that shows a plane that passes through the point $\vec{p}$ and has normal vector $\vec{n}$ and the point with position $\vec{q}$ not on the plane.

Using the {prf:ref}`geometric definition of a dot product<dot-product-definition>` derive an expression for calculating the shortest distance between a point and a plane. Use your expression to find the shortest distance from the point with position vector $(2, 4, -3)^\mathsf{T}$ to the plane $6x - y - 4z = 3$.
