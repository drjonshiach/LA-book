    "Vectors are way of expressing quantities that cannot be expressed by a single number. For example, consider the displacement of an object in 2 dimensional space from one location to another. There is a change in the position in one direction and a change in the position of another so a single value cannot carry this information. Vectors were originally used in geometry but have since become important in multivariate calculus, computer graphics, engineering and physics.\n",

    "- define a [vector](vectors-definition-section) in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ Euclidean space, calculate its [magnitude](magnitude-definition) and parallel [unit vector](normalising-a-vector-proposition);\n",
    "- perform the arithmetic operations of [vector addition](vector-addition-definition), [multiplication by a scalar](scalar-multiplication-of-a-vector-definition), [dot product](dot-product-definition) and [cross product](cross-product-definition);\n",
    "- express a vector as a [linear combination of vectors](linear-combination-of-vectors-definition)."
